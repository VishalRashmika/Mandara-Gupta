## Quotes
Karma has no menu, you get served what you deserve
If anything is worth doing, fo it with all your heart
Better to be slapped with the truth than kissed with a lie
The trouble is you think you have time
Let the past make you better, not bitter
It is easy to see faults of others, but difficult to see one's own faults
A man is not called wise because he talks and talks again; but is he peaceful, loving and fearless then he is in truth called wise
Sometimes silence is the best solution
Radiate boundless love towards the entire world
A disciplined mind brings happiness
Give, even if you only have a little
Those who cling to perceptions and views wander the world offending people
Drop by drop is the water pot filled
