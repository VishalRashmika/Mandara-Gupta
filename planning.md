## Quotes
Karma has no menu, you get served what you deserve
If anything is worth doing, fo it with all your heart
Better to be slapped with the truth than kissed with a lie
The trouble is you think you have time
Let the past make you better, not bitter
It is easy to see faults of others, but difficult to see one's own faults
A man is not called wise because he talks and talks again; but is he peaceful, loving and fearless then he is in truth called wise
